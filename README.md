# BookSwap

BookSwap is a software application developed to facilitate book exchanges between users. The project focuses on applying core software engineering principles, including object-oriented design, data persistence, and clean code practices.

## Overview
The application allows users to create accounts, manage personal book collections, browse available books, and initiate book exchange requests. It was developed as a personal project to gain hands-on experience in building structured and maintainable software systems.

## Key Features
- User authentication and profile management
- Book collection management (add, update, remove books)
- Search and filtering of available books
- Book exchange request handling
- Input validation and error handling

## Technologies and Concepts
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Relational Databases (SQL)
- CRUD operations
- Basic software architecture (layered design)
- Git version control

## Project Structure
The project is organized using a modular structure that separates:
- Data models
- Business logic
- Data persistence layer

This structure improves maintainability and scalability.

## Installation and Run
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/margiteo/BookSwap.git
2. Open the project in an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Configure the database connection if required.
4. Build and run the application.

## Motivation
This project was created to strengthen practical programming skills and to demonstrate the ability to design and implement a complete application, from requirements to implementation.

## Future Improvements
- Refactoring toward a REST-based architecture
- Improved exception handling and logging
- Enhanced user interface
- Performance optimizations
